**Problem Statement**  
Briefly describe the gap or pain point you’re experiencing with Mighty Portal.  
> e.g. “Jumping long distances in a sprawling terrain via the Scene view camera is slow and imprecise, forcing me to scrub around or manually reposition the view.”

**Proposed Solution**  
Describe exactly what you’d like Mighty Portal to do.  
> e.g. “Add a ‘Saved Portal Points’ system—let me bookmark locations in the scene, assign hotkeys, and instantly teleport the Scene camera to them.”

**Use Case / Scenario**  
Explain how and where you would use this feature in your project.  
> e.g. “When blocking out a level, I need to hop between the player start, enemy spawn areas, and key landmarks without losing my current view or manual camera setup.”

**Alternatives Considered**  
List any workarounds or other tools you tried and why they fell short.  
> e.g. “I tried using scene bookmarks in Unity’s built-in tools, but they don’t preserve camera rotation or field of view, making each jump jarring.”

**Benefit / Impact**  
Who benefits and how this feature will improve your workflow or game.  
> e.g. “Level designers and environment artists can navigate complex scenes 3× faster, maintaining camera framing and eliminating repetitive manual panning.”

**Mockups / Sketches (optional)**  
Attach any diagrams, screenshots or rough sketches that illustrate your idea (e.g. UI for saving/loading portal points, hotkey labels).

**Additional Context**  
Any other notes—API preferences, integration with existing minimap/timeline features, performance concerns when handling hundreds of bookmarks, etc.
